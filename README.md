## Introduction

This is a simple, interactive color flooding game developed in Java using the Swing framework. The game logic is primarily based on the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. The purpose of this project is to create a fun and visual approach to understanding and implementing the DFS algorithm.

## Game Mechanics

The game starts with a grid filled with random colors. When a cell is clicked, it changes the color of the initial grid cell (top-left) and all connected cells to the clicked cell's color. The objective is to fill the grid with a single color in the fewest number of steps.
